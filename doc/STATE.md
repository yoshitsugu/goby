# Goby Project State Snapshot

Last updated: 2026-03-31

## Current Focus

**Track CC / CC2** (next): Runtime representation.
CC1 (analysis and IR ownership) is complete — capture classification, `MutableStorageId`
shared-cell model, `CallableEnv` metadata, and acceptance-program rejection tests are all in.
CC2 will define the closure-record layout, heap mutable-cell representation, and the helper
layer for closure-environment load/store.

## Recently Completed

- **Track CC / CC1** (2026-03-31): All CC1 milestones complete.
  - Shared closure-capture analysis in `crates/goby-core/src/closure_capture.rs`
  - `CallableEnv` / `CallableEnvSlot` / `MutableStorageId` ownership model
  - Wasm backend rejects capturing lambdas via shared metadata (not backend-local traversal)
  - Acceptance-program rejection tests for all five Section 3 shapes
- **`fn`-only anonymous functions** (2026-03-31): Pipe-lambda `|x| ->` removed. `fn x -> expr` is the only form. Parser rejects old syntax; formatter, tooling, docs, and all tests updated.
- **Track H / HOF milestone series** (complete through HOF-M7): `fn` keyword, multi-param lambdas, effectful callbacks, `fold`, end-to-end acceptance gate.
- **Track E** (HOF type checking, 2026-03-27): Callback arity mismatches rejected at `goby-cli check`.
- **Track F** (stdlib `int.to_string`, 2026-03-25): End-to-end; direct calls and named callback use covered.
- **Track ER** (compiler error reporting, 2026-03-29): Unresolved/ambiguous names, import diagnostics, CLI/LSP parity.

## Immediate Next Steps

Next track candidates are in `doc/PLAN.md` §4:

- **Track CC: Closure Capture** (§4.6): CC1 complete. Next: CC2 — closure-record layout, mutable-cell heap representation, and environment load/store helpers.
- **Track D follow-ups** (§4.1): D5 (`goby lint` unused-binding rule), D6c shared grammar asset.
- **Track WB-3B** (deferred): WasmFX typed continuations — on hold until WebAssembly stack switching reaches Phase 4.
- **Float support** (§4.7): `Float` type backed by Wasm `f64`; semantics to be locked before coding.

## Architecture State

- Resolved-form → shared IR boundary is stable (IR0–IR11 done).
- Wasm backend lowering design is locked in `doc/PLAN_IR.md`:
  - Phase WB-1: pure control flow and operators ✓
  - Phase WB-2: pattern matching and structured data ✓
  - Phase WB-3: function values and effect handlers (direct-call lowering, one-shot tail-resumptive) ✓
  - Phase WB-3B (future): WasmFX stack switching when proposal reaches Phase 4
- `GeneralLowered` coverage includes:
  - Pure control flow: `If`, `BinOp`, `Interp`, `LetMut`, `Assign`
  - Pattern matching: `Case` with literal/list patterns
  - Structured data: `ListLit`, `TupleLit`, `RecordLit`
  - Decl calls / recursion / higher-order funcref calls
  - Backend effect dispatch (typed `BackendEffectOp` / `BackendPrintOp`)
  - stdlib `list.each` / `list.map` / `list.fold`
  - Effect handlers: `Handle` / `WithHandler` / tail `Resume` (one-shot tail-resumptive subset)
  - Function values: `Lambda` (no-capture only); stdlib `graphemes` via wrapper AuxDecl
  - Host intrinsics: `StringGraphemesList` (`__goby_string_graphemes_list`)
- Known limitations:
  - non-tail / multi-resume handlers → `BackendLimitation` error
  - lambda with free variables (closure capture) still returns `UnsupportedForm` on the Wasm path, but the rejection now comes from shared callable-environment metadata rather than backend-local free-variable traversal
  - inline capturing lambda passed to HOF callbacks (e.g. `fold (fn acc x -> acc + x + bias)`) → `UnsupportedForm` on Wasm path — Track CC (CC4) will implement
  - interpreter path: capturing lambdas work but use snapshot semantics for `mut` captures (not the spec's shared-cell model); will be corrected as part of Track CC
