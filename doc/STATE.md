# Goby Project State Snapshot

Last updated: 2026-05-08.

## Current Focus

**No active implementation track.** Track PC is the next primary target
once the user finishes the design review in `tmp/pc.md`.

## Known Red / Green State

Green:

- `cargo test -p goby-core --lib`: 917 passed / 2 ignored.
- `cargo check --workspace`: warning-free.
- `cargo test -p goby-lsp`: 56 passed / 0 failed.
- `cargo nextest run -p goby-wasm -E 'not test(fold_m5_string_accumulator)'`:
  the regular wasm suite passes (856 / 12 skipped).

Red / ignored:

- Pre-existing `#[ignore]`d perceus / compile_tests entries (see
  `doc/BUGS.md` for any per-case detail).
- `goby-wasm` lib test `tests::fold_m5_string_accumulator` is a known
  CPU-bound hang on this checkout; track it via `doc/BUGS.md` and skip
  it in nextest runs.

## Next Step

**Primary (queued, blocked on user design review):**

- **Track PC: Parser combinator on algebraic effects**
  (`doc/PLAN.md` §4.6). PC-0 design lock is the immediate next
  action once the user finishes reviewing `tmp/pc.md`. After that,
  motivating fixtures (`parser_number`, `parser_arith`,
  `parser_json_lite`) land as failing examples. PC-2 remains gated
  on §3.3 multi-shot / branch-local state.

**PC blockers (orthogonal to PC-0):**

- **§3.3 multi-shot classification + branch-local state surface**: the
  only remaining hard PC-2 blocker.

**Other queued tracks (lower priority):**

- Track OOB (out-of-bounds handling polish; `doc/PLAN.md` §4.5).
- Track D D5/D6 follow-ups (`goby lint`; `doc/PLAN.md` §4.1).
- Track RR-6 limit tuning (`doc/PLAN.md` §4.5 RR).

**Parallel known-red cleanup (lowest priority):**

- **Grapheme-track roadmap-label hygiene**: residual `e4_` / `e5_` /
  `e6_` test prefixes and comment-internal `E4` / `E5` / `E6`
  references survive in `crates/goby-wasm/src/lib.rs`,
  `crates/goby-wasm/src/compile_tests.rs`, and
  `crates/goby-wasm/tests/wasm_exports_and_smoke.rs`. Rewrite per
  `doc/PLAN.md` §2 (locked 2026-03-25) when a grapheme-related track
  is opened or as a standalone hygiene PR.
- Pre-existing typecheck regressions in 8 example files
  (`case_arm_block.gb`, `function_reference.gb`, `list_set.gb`,
  `list_spread.gb`, `mut.gb`, `string_graphemes.gb`, `tco.gb`,
  `to_integer.gb`) reproduce on the `975863e` baseline. Triage
  separately with a `doc/BUGS.md` entry per case.
