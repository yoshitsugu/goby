# Goby Language Plan (Draft)

This document tracks:

- what is already visible from examples,
- what must be fixed for MVP,
- what can be postponed.

Note:

- `doc/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` is the source of truth for current language
  syntax/semantics.
- This `PLAN.md` file is for roadmap/migration/execution planning.
- Workflow rule: when language syntax/semantics change, update
  `doc/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` in the same change.
- Workflow rule: when language syntax changes, also verify whether syntax
  highlighting definitions need updates (`tooling/syntax/textmate`,
  `tooling/vscode-goby/syntaxes`, `tooling/emacs`, `tooling/vim`), and update
  them in the same change when needed.

## 1. Confirmed in Current Draft

Based on `examples/*.gb`:

- `.gb` source file extension
- Function definition syntax: `name args = expr`
- Type annotation syntax: `name : A -> B`
- Type inference for omitted annotations
- Statement terminator: newline or `;`
- Indentation-based block expressions
- Function-local scopes and blocks are defined by indentation
  (spaces and tabs are both allowed)
- Last expression is the return value
- Effect annotation syntax: `can Print`
- Anonymous functions: `|x| -> ...` and placeholder shorthand (`_ * 10`)
- Named function references are valid in higher-order call positions
  (for example: `map xs add_ten` when the parameter expects a function value).
- Basic shown types: `Int`, `String`, tuple `(A, B)`, `List T`

## 2. MVP Decisions and Remaining Open Items

### 2.0 Locked for Current MVP

- Development-phase change policy (locked 2026-03-04):
  - This project is still in a personal early-development phase; immediate breaking
    changes are allowed when they improve consistency/simplicity.
  - However, avoid short-sighted shortcuts that are likely to become long-term design debt.
    Even if a change is breaking now, it should still align with plausible future
    language/tooling architecture.
  - Phase 5 execution policy (locked 2026-03-09):
    - optimize for architecture quality, but make progress in small reversible steps.
    - prefer additive `Out`-path entrypoints first; keep legacy fallback until parity is proven.
    - do not refactor `eval_expr_ast` broadly in one step; migrate one call path at a time.
    - after each micro-step, run focused regression tests first, then full quality gate.
    - if a step fails, revert that step and retry with a smaller scope.
  - Intentional-break policy for design-first work (locked 2026-03-09):
    - target is globally rational and healthy architecture over local short-term stability.
    - temporary breakage is allowed when needed for the ideal design change.
    - before changing code, explicitly list expected breakages and affected tests/paths.
    - proceed only while breakages remain understandable and recoverable.
    - operational rollback thresholds:
      - if two consecutive attempts fail to narrow breakage to one subsystem/file group,
        roll back to the last stable commit.
      - if expected breakages cannot be converted into concrete failing tests/paths within
        30 minutes, roll back and retry with a narrower change unit.
    - if breakage becomes hard to reason about or cannot be handled, roll back to the
      last stable point and retry with a narrower change unit.

- Function calls support both `f x` and `f(x)`.
  - spaced application supports multiple args (`f a b c`) and is parsed left-associatively
    (`(((f a) b) c)`).
  - `f(x)` is used when precedence needs to be explicit.
  - `f ()` is parsed as Unit-argument function application.
  - constructor parsing follows naming convention: only `CamelCase(...)` / `CamelCase (...)`
    is treated as constructor form.
- Naming convention lock:
  - top-level declaration names start with lowercase (`_` reserved for intrinsic/internal symbols).
  - `type` / `effect` declarations and constructors are `CamelCase`.
- Block-local binding semantics are fixed for MVP:
  - `name = expr` is a local binding statement only when `name` is an identifier and `=` is assignment (not `==`).
  - bindings are visible to subsequent statements in the same declaration body.
  - re-binding the same name in the same body is allowed; the newer binding shadows the older one from that point onward.
  - bindings are declaration-local and do not escape to other declarations.
- Operator precedence/associativity is fixed for MVP:
  - precedence (low -> high): pipeline `|>` < addition `+` < multiplication `*` < call/application (`f x`, `f(x)`, `receiver.method(...)`).
  - `|>`, `+`, `*` are left-associative.
  - for MVP parser compatibility, infix `+` and `*` require spaces on both sides.
  - pipeline callee must be an identifier (`expr |> f`).
- Type annotation style is unified to `name : Type`.
- Statement terminators are newline or `;`.
- Comment syntax is fixed for MVP:
  - single-line comment marker is `#`.
  - line-end comments are allowed (for example: `x = 1 # note`).
  - `#` starts a comment only outside string literals; inside strings it is a normal character.
  - block comment syntax is not included in MVP.
  - `#!` has no special shebang handling in MVP; it is treated as a normal `#` comment.
- Generic type application syntax is fixed to Haskell-style spacing:
  - single-parameter examples: `List Int`.
  - multi-parameter examples: `TypeX a b`.
  - nested applications requiring grouping use parentheses: `TypeX (TypeY a b) c`.
  - diagnostics should render type applications in the same style.
- Indentation-based blocks accept both tabs and spaces.
  - for MVP, any line with at least one leading space or tab is treated as an indented block line.
  - mixing tabs and spaces in the same block is allowed in MVP (no normalization/error rule yet).
- CLI commands:
  - `goby-cli run <file.gb>` uses `main` entrypoint only and executes generated Wasm via external `wasmtime`.
    - if `wasmtime` is not installed, execution is skipped with an informational message.
    - current invocation: `wasmtime run <file.wasm>` with WASI-standard `_start` export.
  - `goby-cli check <file.gb>` performs parse/typecheck without runtime entrypoint.
- `main` type is restricted to `Unit -> Unit` for MVP.
  - `main` type annotation is required for `run`; optional for `check`.
- Legacy `void` type spelling is rejected in type annotations.
- First backend target is Wasm.
- Effects and handlers are available in MVP runtime via `effect`, `handler`, and `with`.
  - handler dispatch follows lexical nearest-handler stack order.
  - `can` clauses are validated (declared effect or built-in effect names).
- Handler application syntax supports:
  - inline handler: `with` + indented clauses + `in <body>`
  - handler value: `with <handler_expr> in <body>`
- Legacy syntax (`handler ... for ...`, `using`) is no longer accepted by the
  language parser as of 2026-03-04.
  - CLI commands (`check` / `run`) therefore reject such sources by default.
- MVP built-ins: `print`, `fetch_env_var`, `string.split`, `list.join`.
  - list mapping should use stdlib `goby/list.map`.
  - `print` execution is resolved by compiler/runtime internals (default stdio print path),
    not by a user-visible stdlib handler definition.
- Stdlib integer parse entrypoint is `int.parse`.
  - contract: parse optional leading `-` + one or more ASCII digits as base-10 `Int`.
  - failure path is effect-based: `StringParseError.invalid_integer : String -> Int`.
- `examples/basic_types.gb` is a parse/typecheck target, not a runnable entrypoint target.
  - no `main` addition and no `--entry` option in MVP.
- `examples/function.gb` is a canonical MVP run target and must be preserved as-is.
  - no simplification/downgrade of `examples/function.gb` is allowed.
  - `goby-cli run examples/function.gb` target output is:
    - `90`
    - `[30, 40, 50]`
    - `[60, 70]`
    - `something`
    - `15`
- String escape sequences in string literals: `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`.
- `case` expression syntax: multi-line lookahead, arm separator ` -> `, wildcard `_`.
  - `CasePattern` supports:
    - `IntLit`, `StringLit`, `BoolLit` (`True`/`False`), `Wildcard`
    - list patterns: `[]`, `[head, ..tail]`, `[x]`, `[x, y]`, `[4, ..]`, `[_, _]`
  - list-pattern typing/matching intent:
    - `[]` matches only empty `List _`.
    - `[p1, p2, ...]` matches list length `>= item_count` (prefix match).
    - in `[head, ..tail]` arm body, `head` is bound to element type `a`, `tail` is bound to `List a`.
    - `_` is wildcard and never creates a binding.
  - parser rejects malformed list patterns (e.g. `[..xs]`, `[x, ..x]`, `[x, ..tail, y]`).
  - `else if` chaining is not supported in MVP.
- `if ... else ...` expression: indentation-based two-branch form.
- `==` equality operator: produces `Bool` at runtime.
- Handler dispatch: lexical nearest-handler stack walk (no alphabetical fallback).
- Runtime execution model: prefer native lowering for the supported subset; fallback to
  compile-time interpreter (`resolve_main_runtime_output`) for unsupported forms.

### 2.1 Syntax and Parsing

- **String interpolation `${}`** (implemented).
  - Parser supports `${ expr }` inside string literals and lowers it to `Expr::InterpolatedString`.
  - Typechecker treats interpolated literals as `String`.
  - Runtime/codegen evaluates each segment and stringifies embedded expression values.
- **List `case` patterns** (implemented).
  - Parser/AST support includes prefix, head-literal, wildcard, and tail-binding forms.
  - List item literals in MVP are `Int` / `String` only (no `Bool` list-pattern items).
  - Parser rejects malformed forms and duplicate binders.
- **`case` arm block body** (implemented, 2026-03-05).
  - Both inline (`pat -> expr`) and block (`pat ->` + indented statements) arm bodies are supported.
  - Block arm type is the type of the last expression; trailing non-expression statement is rejected.
  - `case` is value-returning in all positions; branch type unification enforced for both `if` and `case`.
  - Effectful expressions inside `case` arm blocks work with parity between `check` and `run`.
  - Follow-up: generalize expression-level block parsing beyond `case` arms.
- **Tuple index access `expr.N`** (implemented).
  - `a.0`, `a.1` parse as qualified numeric member access and are typechecked/runtime-evaluated as tuple index access.
  - Numeric member access is valid only for tuple receivers.
  - Non-tuple receivers (for example `Status.0`) are rejected.
- **List spread/concat expression (`[a, b, ..xs]`)** (implemented).
  - Shipped behavior:
    - expression-side list literals support zero or more prefix elements plus one trailing spread segment.
    - examples: `[f(x), ..ys]`, `[a, b, c, ..xs]`.
  - Parsing/AST rules:
    - parser accepts at most one trailing `..expr`.
    - parser rejects malformed forms (`[..xs]`, multiple spread segments, non-trailing spread).
    - `case` list-pattern syntax remains separate from expression syntax.
    - AST stores prefix elements and optional spread tail distinctly.

### 2.2 Types and Checking

- TODO (Deferred): declaration-side generic parameter binders
  (for example, `id : a -> a` with explicit binders).
- Planned numeric expansion: `Float` type backed by Wasm `f64`.
  - intended surface type name is `Float`.
  - initial implementation target is IEEE 754 double precision semantics via Wasm `f64`.
  - MVP scope should stay explicit about unsupported edge cases until diagnostics/runtime text are defined:
    - NaN display/equality wording,
    - infinity parsing/printing policy,
    - mixed `Int`/`Float` operator coercion rules.
- **List `case` pattern typing** (implemented).
  - For `case xs` with list patterns, typecheck verifies scrutinee is `List _` when known.
  - Per-arm local environment extension is implemented:
    - item binders (`[a, b]`, `[a, ..]`) bind each item as `a`.
    - tail binder (`[..tail]` via `[x, ..tail]`) binds `tail : List a`.
  - MVP `Ty::Unknown` tolerance is preserved when information is insufficient.
  - Native Wasm capability checker still treats list patterns as unsupported;
    these cases execute via fallback runtime path.
- **List spread expression typing (`[a, b, ..xs]`)** (implemented).
  - Shipped rules:
    - for `[e1, e2, ..., ..tail]`, all prefix elements must unify to one element type `a`.
    - `tail` must typecheck as `List a`.
    - whole expression type is `List a`.
  - Diagnostics:
    - conflicting prefix element types report expected vs actual element type.
    - non-list or mismatched list tails report the expected `List a` shape explicitly.
- Type annotation placement rules (required vs optional locations).
- Type error diagnostics quality bar is fixed for MVP:
  - diagnostics must be non-empty and human-readable plain text.
  - when a declaration is known, diagnostics must include the declaration name.
  - type mismatch diagnostics must include both expected and actual type names.
  - composite types should be rendered with full shape (for example: `List Int`, `(String, Int)`), not collapsed labels.
  - line/column reporting is not required in MVP.

### 2.3 Effect System

- Target semantics lock (2026-03-15):
  - `can` on a function type means "effects that remain unhandled after evaluating this function body".
  - effects discharged by `with ... in ...` inside the function body must not appear in that function's `can` clause.
  - omitting `can` means the function body must not leave any effect unhandled.
  - calling a `can`-annotated function is allowed only when the caller also accounts for those effects
    (either by an enclosing `with` at the call site or by the caller's own `can` clause).
  - inline `with` clause heads default to unqualified operation names (`yield`) when resolution is unique.
  - if multiple visible effects expose the same operation name, the clause must use a qualified name (`Iterator.yield`).
  - example consequence:
    - `stdlib/goby/string.gb` helpers that invoke `yield` only inside a matching `with` should not carry `can Iterator`.
    - a function that directly calls `say_hello` from `effect Message` without handling it must carry `can Message`.
- Current implemented checks:
  - `can` effect names must be declared (or built-in).
  - uncovered effect operation calls are rejected unless covered by enclosing handler scope
    (`with`).
  - calls to `can`-annotated functions require an appropriate enclosing handler scope.
- Current runtime behavior:
  - effect operations dispatch through installed handlers.
- How to represent multiple effects (`can Print + Read` or other syntax) — deferred.
- Effect propagation rules for higher-order functions — deferred.
- Effect diagnostics UX polish (wording/format consistency) — deferred.
- Warning mechanism for lexical shadowing of visible effect operation names
  (for example local `a` shadows operation `a`) — deferred.
  - resolution rule remains: lexical value namespace wins.
  - warning is planned as tooling/diagnostics improvement, not a type error.

#### `can` Semantics Alignment (completed 2026-03-15)

- Old effect-member dependency model removed (dependency cycles, `op_required_effects` bookkeeping).
- Single residual-effect checker: each expression contributes unhandled effects; `with` discharges them.
- `with` clause name resolution: bare names accepted only when unique; qualified `Effect.operation` required when ambiguous.
- Diagnostics updated; `can Iterator` removed from locally-handled stdlib functions.
- `can` is reserved for unhandled function effects only; effect member signatures do not declare dependency effects.


#### Effect Renewal/Resume Status (Summary)

- Renewal syntax model is locked and active (current shipped behavior as of 2026-03-05):
  - `handler` is a value,
  - handler application uses `with` (inline handler or handler value form).
- Legacy forms (`handler ... for ...`, `using`) are fully removed from parser/runtime/typecheck paths.
- `resume` support is active on current semantics:
  - outside-handler `resume` is rejected,
  - resumed-value type mismatch is rejected,
  - conservative syntactic multi-`resume` rejection is removed,
  - multi-resume progression is active (continuation advances to next resumable point),
  - handler clause completion without `resume` exits only the current
    `with ... in ...` scope with clause value.
- Runtime dispatch semantics:
  - nearest lexical handler wins,
  - embedded/default-handler fallback applies only when no explicit handler captures the operation.
- Post-MVP follow-up remains:
  - continue migration from name-based runtime dispatch to compiled operation identity (`EffectId`/`OpId`),
  - evaluate explicit `discontinue` only as a later separate proposal.

#### `with` Syntax Unification (completed 2026-03-05)

- `with` is the only handler-application syntax (inline and handler-value forms).
- Legacy `handler ... for ...` / `using` syntax removed from parser/runtime/typecheck.


### 2.4 Standard Library Surface (MVP)

- Core modules to ship first (`Int`, `String`, `List`, `Env`) — minimal built-ins implemented.
- Naming conventions for stdlib functions — established.
- Minimal collection API for immutable workflows — deferred.
- `List.map` migration plan (planned):
  - keep canonical map behavior in `stdlib/goby/list.gb` (`list.map` export path).
  - replace internal/builtin-path map callsites with stdlib module usage where possible.
  - after migration, trim builtin-only `map` special handling so runtime/compiler has a single semantics source.

### 2.5 Runtime / Compiler Scope (MVP)

- Current model: native Wasm code generation for the supported subset, with deterministic
  fallback behavior for unsupported forms.
- Real Wasm migration plan (Phase 0-8) is completed; implementation record is archived.
- Error location strategy (line/column reporting) — deferred.

### 2.6 Tooling Scope (MVP)

- Minimum CLI commands (`goby-cli run`, `goby-cli check`) — complete.
- Project layout and package metadata format (Cargo workspace with `goby-core`, `goby-cli`, `goby-wasm`) — complete.
- Tooling direction is now explicit:
  - prioritize early developer-environment support (syntax highlight, formatter, linter, LSP),
  - keep diagnostics/messages stable enough to be consumed by editor tooling.

## 3. Later-Phase Decisions

- Module/package ecosystem and remote dependency management.
- Advanced effects (async, state, cancellation, effect-safety diagnostics).
- Potential explicit `discontinue` syntax as a clarity-focused effect-control extension
  (deferred; not part of current `resume` rollout).
- Pattern matching exhaustiveness and advanced ADTs.
- Interoperability/FFI strategy.
- Governance model, RFC process, compatibility policy.
- Real Wasm code generation (replace compile-time interpreter).
- Declaration-side generic parameter binders.
- Handler clause body type-checking improvements (effect-safety and diagnostics polish).
- `else if` chaining in `if` expressions.
- REPL or interactive mode.

## 4. Next Phase Plan

Post-MVP focus is to reduce fallback-runtime special-cases and make execution paths
predictable.

### 4.1 Completed Work (Summary)

- Effect call dispatch in `main` body (`bare` / `qualified` / `pipeline`) is implemented.
- Mutable local syntax (`mut` / `:=`) is implemented with parser/typecheck/runtime coverage.
- Wasm track refactor split (`call.rs`, `support.rs`) and `function.gb` native HOF subset support are implemented.
- Stdlib foundation milestones already merged:
  - stdlib source loading from `stdlib/goby/*`,
  - stdlib-only `@embed` model,
  - implicit `goby/prelude`,
  - Unit value `()` path,
  - `Print` split (`print` / `println`),
  - `Read` default handler (`read`, `read_line`),
  - `goby/string.graphemes` iterator-backed Unicode grapheme segmentation helper.
- Editor syntax packs (VSCode/Emacs/Vim/TextMate) are implemented.

Note: detailed execution history for these items is retained in git history and
`doc/STATE.md`; this section keeps only decision-level summaries.

### 4.2 Closed Tracks Archive

Tracks A/B/C are closed. Detailed records were removed from this plan file and
are retained in `doc/STATE.md` and git history.

### 4.3 Active Track D: Developer Tooling Foundation

Goal: establish practical developer tooling — diagnostics in editors, a formatter, and a
linter — built on `goby-core` as the single analysis source.

#### Completed phases

- **D1a** (2026-03-15): `Span` with end position; `Stmt`/`Expr` span fields; position helpers in `span.rs`.
- **D1b** (2026-03-16): Unified `Diagnostic` type; `From<ParseError>` + `From<TypecheckError>`; single CLI render path.
- **D1c** (2026-03-16): `span: Some(...)` populated at annotation + effect-decl error sites; sentinel convention documented.
- **D1d** (2026-03-16): Ruby/Elm-style `file:line:col: error:` header + gutter + `^^^` underline in `goby-cli check`.
- **D2a** (2026-03-16): `goby-lsp` crate; LSP lifecycle; diagnostics via `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`; `span_to_lsp_range` UTF-16 conversion.
- **D2b** (2026-03-17): `typecheck_module_collect` / `typecheck_module_collect_with_context`; all per-declaration errors reported in CLI and LSP.
- **D3a** (2026-03-17): `SymbolIndex`; `textDocument/hover` + `textDocument/definition` for top-level declarations and effect members.
- **D3b** (2026-03-17): `infer_local_bindings`; hover for local binding definition lines (definition-line only; use-site deferred).
- **D4** (2026-03-17): `format_module` in goby-core (comment-drop, Option A); `goby fmt <file>` + `goby fmt --check`; 17 idempotency tests.

#### Phase D5: `goby lint` — high-signal static checks

Goal: machine-readable linter output for common mistakes not caught by the typechecker.

Lint rules ordered by ascending analysis cost (cheapest infrastructure first to unblock
the lint framework early; user-value ranking noted in parentheses for future prioritization):

1. **Unreachable `case` arm**: wildcard `_` arm followed by more arms (purely syntactic, cheapest).
   User value: medium — catches subtle logic errors in pattern matching.
2. **Unused local binding**: `x = expr` where `x` is never referenced afterward
   (needs local-use tracking across `Expr`/`Stmt` spans from D1a).
   User value: **high** — most frequently encountered lint in practice; catches typos and dead code.
   Note: despite higher analysis cost than rule 1, consider implementing early if the
   lint framework from rule 1 is already in place, as this delivers the most user value.
3. **Shadowed effect operation name**: local binding name collides with a visible effect op
   (needs symbol table from D3a, no use-tracking required).
   User value: medium — prevents confusing name collisions specific to Goby's effect system.
4. **Redundant `can` annotation**: effect is fully discharged inside the function body
   (needs effect discharge analysis; implement last to avoid noisy warnings).
   User value: medium — helps keep effect annotations accurate.

Output format:

- Human-readable (default): same caret-snippet format as `goby-cli check`.
- JSON lines (`--json`): `{"severity":"warning","file":"...","line":1,"col":1,"rule":"unreachable-arm","message":"..."}`.

Done when:

- Each rule is implemented and enabled one at a time (separate commits).
- Each rule has at least one positive fixture (warning fired) and one negative fixture (no warning).
- `goby lint examples/function.gb` exits 0 on all existing clean sources.
- JSON output is parseable; schema documented.

#### Phase D6: Editor extensions — VS Code and Neovim

Goal: make `goby-lsp` and `goby fmt` usable out-of-the-box in mainstream editors
without manual LSP configuration.  Ship a VS Code extension and a Neovim plugin,
both auto-discovering the `goby-lsp` binary from `PATH` or a workspace-local build.

Dependencies: D2a (goby-lsp binary functional), D4 (goby fmt functional).
D5 (goby lint) is optional; lint diagnostics flow through the LSP diagnostic channel
automatically once D5 is done.

##### D6a: VS Code extension (`editors/vscode/`)

Scope:

- New directory `editors/vscode/` with a standard VS Code extension project:
  - `package.json`: publisher, display name (`Goby Language Support`), activationEvents
    (`onLanguage:goby`), contributes `languages` (id `goby`, extensions `[".gb"]`),
    contributes `commands` (`goby.formatDocument`), configurationDefaults.
  - `src/extension.ts`: entry point using `vscode-languageclient/node`
    (`LanguageClient` with `serverOptions` → `goby-lsp`).
  - `language-configuration.json`: comment toggle (`# ...`), bracket pairs, indentation rules.
  - `syntaxes/goby.tmLanguage.json`: minimal TextMate grammar for syntax highlighting
    (keywords: `effect`, `handler`, `with`, `can`, `mut`, `case`, `if`, `else`, `import`;
    literals; identifiers; string interpolation `"${...}"`; line comments `#`).
- Server resolution order:
  1. `goby.serverPath` VS Code setting (user-specified absolute path).
  2. `PATH` lookup of `goby-lsp`.
  3. Workspace-local `./target/debug/goby-lsp` / `./target/release/goby-lsp`.
  - If not found: show an informational message with a link to build instructions.
- Format-on-save: invoke `goby fmt --check`; if it fails, run `goby fmt` and apply
  the result as a workspace edit (or use LSP `textDocument/formatting` once added).
- `goby.formatOnSave` setting (boolean, default `true`).
- VSIX packaging: `npm run package` produces `goby-language-support-<version>.vsix`
  installable with `code --install-extension`.
- README in `editors/vscode/` with install + usage instructions.

Done when:

- Opening a `.gb` file in VS Code activates the extension.
- Diagnostics from `goby-lsp` appear as editor squiggles.
- Hover shows type annotation for top-level and local binding names.
- Go-to-definition jumps to the declaration.
- Save triggers `goby fmt` (when `goby.formatOnSave` is true).
- `npm run package` succeeds and produces a `.vsix`.

##### D6b: Neovim plugin (`editors/nvim/`)

Scope:

- New directory `editors/nvim/` as a self-contained Lua plugin (compatible with
  `lazy.nvim`, `packer.nvim`, and manual `runtimepath` installation):
  - `lua/goby/init.lua`: public API — `require("goby").setup(opts)`.
  - `lua/goby/lsp.lua`: registers `goby-lsp` as an `nvim-lspconfig`-compatible LSP
    server entry and calls `lspconfig.goby_lsp.setup(opts)`.
  - `lua/goby/format.lua`: `goby.format()` command — shell-calls `goby fmt` on the
    current buffer's file; reloads the buffer if changed.
  - `ftdetect/goby.vim`: sets `filetype=goby` for `*.gb` files.
  - `ftplugin/goby.vim`: sets `commentstring=# %s`, `expandtab`, `shiftwidth=2`.
  - `syntax/goby.vim`: Vim syntax file for environments without Tree-sitter.
- Server resolution: same order as D6a (`opts.server_path` → PATH → workspace local).
- Auto-format-on-save: `autocmd BufWritePost *.gb` when `opts.format_on_save = true`
  (default true).
- `opts` table: `{ server_path, format_on_save, on_attach, capabilities }`.
- Tree-sitter grammar (optional, separate sub-directory `editors/nvim/tree-sitter-goby/`):
  - `grammar.js` covering top-level declarations, effect/handler blocks, expressions,
    statements, and string interpolation.
  - Queries: `highlights.scm`, `indents.scm`.
  - This sub-step is optional for D6b completion; it becomes D6b-ts if deferred.
- README in `editors/nvim/` with `lazy.nvim` snippet, manual install instructions,
  and key-mapping examples.

Done when:

- `:lua require("goby").setup()` in Neovim starts `goby-lsp` for `*.gb` files.
- Diagnostics, hover, and go-to-definition work via the Neovim LSP client.
- `:GobyFormat` (or save) invokes `goby fmt`.
- Plugin is installable via `lazy.nvim` with a one-liner spec.

##### D6c: Shared grammar asset (`editors/shared/`)

Scope:

- Extract the language definition (keywords, operators, string interpolation pattern)
  into a canonical `editors/shared/goby-language.json` used by both the VS Code grammar
  and the Neovim syntax file to avoid duplication.
- This is a refactor step after D6a and D6b are both working; it ensures future
  keyword additions only need to be made in one place.

Done when:

- VS Code `.tmLanguage.json` and Neovim `syntax/goby.vim` are generated from or
  directly reference `editors/shared/goby-language.json`.
- Adding a new keyword to the shared file propagates correctly to both editors.

#### Milestones summary

### 4.4 Review Follow-ups (Backlog)

The following items were identified in a focused code review and are tracked as
near/mid-term engineering debt after current active tracks.

Priority-ordered follow-ups:

1. Typecheck env cloning strategy:
   - Replace repeated full `TypeEnv` clone on local scope transitions with a
     cheaper scope-chain/persistent-map strategy (`Rc` + parent chain or equivalent).
2. Large-function decomposition for testability/readability:
   - candidate functions include `eval_expr_ast`, `execute_unit_expr_ast`,
     `check_unhandled_effects_in_expr`, `check_resume_in_expr`, `check_body_stmts`,
     and parser/lowering long functions.
3. Hot-path allocation reduction:
   - remove avoidable clones in Wasm runtime dispatch paths (`find_map` + clone patterns,
     local/callable env cloning in frequently executed branches).
4. Planning call-graph closure algorithm:
   - replace naive fixed-point transitive closure with worklist/topological strategy
     to avoid avoidable quadratic behavior on larger declaration graphs.
5. Small algorithmic cleanups:
   - replace `collect + sort + first` selection patterns with `min_by(_key)` where applicable.
6. Shared utility deduplication:
   - unify duplicated `find_can_keyword_index` and resume-detection helpers across modules.
7. Diagnostics metadata completeness:
   - add source span/line metadata to type/effect declaration AST nodes so type errors
     can consistently report precise locations (LSP-friendly diagnostics).

Note:

- Critical correctness items from the same review batch were already fixed:
  parser explicit early-return clarity and planning `u16` overflow fail-fast behavior.

### 4.5 Active Track E: `Float` / Wasm `f64` Support

Goal: add a first-class `Float` type with predictable parser/typechecker/runtime/Wasm behavior.

Why this is a separate track:

- `Float` crosses language surface, type rules, runtime behavior, stdlib shape, and Wasm lowering.
- the design needs a few semantics to be locked before implementation to avoid ad-hoc numeric behavior.

Scope to lock before coding:

1. Literal syntax
   - canonical decimal forms for `Float` literals (for example `1.0`, `0.5`, `-3.25`).
   - whether exponent notation (`1e3`, `1.2e-3`) is included in the first slice.
   - parser boundary with tuple/member syntax so `1.0` is never confused with `expr.0`.
2. Type/system rules
   - `Float` is a distinct primitive type, not an alias of `Int`.
   - decide whether mixed arithmetic is rejected initially or whether `Int -> Float` promotion exists for operators/calls.
   - comparison/equality semantics must be explicit, especially around NaN.
3. Runtime/CLI behavior
   - printing/rendering policy for `Float`.
   - parse/runtime behavior for NaN, `inf`, `-inf`, and division edge cases.
4. Stdlib surface
   - introduce a minimal `goby/float` module only if it has a clearly defined first API surface.

Execution phases:

1. Phase E1: Syntax and semantic lock
   - define accepted literal grammar and operator coverage.
   - decide initial coercion policy:
     - preferred conservative default: no implicit `Int`/`Float` mixing in MVP; require exact operand types until explicit conversion APIs exist.
   - update `doc/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`, examples, and diagnostics wording once semantics are locked.
2. Phase E2: Core representation and parsing
   - add `Float` to AST/type representations.
   - teach the lexer/parser to recognize `Float` literals without regressing tuple-index/member access parsing.
   - add parser regression tests for decimal literals, negatives, malformed literals, and `expr.0` ambiguity cases.
3. Phase E3: Typechecker and operators
   - add `Float` typing rules for literals, annotations, and supported operators.
   - implement diagnostics for invalid mixed arithmetic if coercion stays disabled.
   - ensure branch/type-unification paths report `Int` vs `Float` mismatches clearly.
4. Phase E4: Runtime and Wasm lowering
   - extend interpreter/fallback runtime with `Float` values and operator execution.
   - lower `Float` values/operators to Wasm `f64`.
   - verify parity between fallback execution and native Wasm execution for the supported subset.
5. Phase E5: Stdlib, examples, and tooling follow-through
   - add or update canonical examples using `Float`.
   - extend formatter/linter/LSP assumptions if numeric literal/token handling needs updates.
   - add diagnostics/hover rendering coverage for `Float`.

Acceptance criteria:

- `Float` annotations and literals are accepted by `check` for the supported syntax.
- supported `Float` arithmetic behaves consistently in fallback runtime and Wasm-native execution.
- diagnostics clearly distinguish `Int` from `Float`.
- docs/examples/spec are updated in the same slice that lands behavior.

### 4.6 Track F: List Index Access `l[i]` — **completed 2026-03-16**

`expr[expr]` syntax for `List` index access. All phases (F1a–F4) shipped:

- AST: `Expr::ListIndex { list, index }`, all exhaustive match sites patched.
- Parser: right-to-left suffix scan in `parse_list_index_suffix`; handles chaining,
  list-literal receivers, paren-grouped receivers, string literals in index. Key precedence:
  `f xs[0]` → `ListIndex(Call(f,xs), 0)`; use `f (xs[0])` to index before calling.
- Typechecker: element type inference; rejects non-`List` receiver and non-`Int` index;
  `Ty::Unknown` / `Ty::Var` pass through without error.
- Runtime: `ListInt` / `ListString` dispatch in `eval_expr_ast`; negative or OOB index →
  `mark_runtime_abort()`; non-list receiver also aborts. OOB bounds check uses
  `i >= items.len() as i64` (safe on wasm32).
- Spec: `LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` updated; `examples/list_index.gb` added.
- Known limitation: `List (List T)` is not yet a representable `RuntimeValue`;
  chained indexing only works if intermediate results are `Int` or `String`.

### 4.7 Parking Lot (Needs Revalidation Before Implementation)

- CLI `build` expansion details (`--target`, `--engine-compat`, verify modes).
- CLI binary naming migration (`goby-cli` -> `goby`) final policy.

These items are intentionally kept as short placeholders until they become active.

### 4.8 Active Track G: Shared Typed IR Boundary

Goal: replace AST-shape-driven backend decisions with a shared typed IR between
`goby-core` and backend lowering.

Why this is the next architecture track:

- current runtime-I/O support in `crates/goby-wasm` relies on source-shape
  classification, which does not scale to semantically equivalent programs,
- effectful execution is currently split across AST matching, backend-local
  planning, and fallback runtime behavior,
- Goby should establish a long-term compiler boundary now, while breaking
  internal architecture is still cheap.

Execution note:

- detailed design, scope, migration phases, and acceptance criteria are tracked
  in `doc/PLAN_IR.md`.
- until Track G is implemented, avoid adding new ad-hoc AST-shape cases to
  backend runtime-I/O planning unless needed for emergency unblock work.



## 5. Spec Detail Notes

### Still Open (Post-MVP)

- Effects/handlers: lexical nearest-handler runtime semantics are active; post-MVP work is to move from interpreter/runtime lookup to compiled `EffectId`/`OpId` tables.
- Effects/handlers (`resume` follow-up): tighten multi-shot static analysis beyond
  the current conservative "multiple syntactic `resume`" rejection.
- Effects/handlers (`resume` extension): evaluate explicit `discontinue` syntax
  as a separate language-design proposal.
- Effect namespace rules: qualified vs unqualified calls, unhandled-effect diagnostics format.
- Type annotation placement: where annotations are required vs optional outside current MVP subset.
- Tuple/record roadmap: record update syntax, pattern matching on record fields.
- Import system: filesystem-backed/local package resolution, dependency graph rules.
- Equality/comparison: operator set (`!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.) and type constraints.
